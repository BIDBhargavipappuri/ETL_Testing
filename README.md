Testing tasks performed 

•ETL testing begins with reviewing the Business Requirement Document (BRD), which provides info what data needs to be moved, transformed, and reported.

•From the BRD, testers identify key data sources, transformation rules, and target systems. 

•ETL Developers then create test cases to validate each ETL step—ensuring data is correctly extracted, transformed according to business logic, and loaded into the destination. 

•SQL queries are used to check data accuracy, completeness, and consistency between source and target.

•	Usually, Testers will test the data in target , compare results with source.
